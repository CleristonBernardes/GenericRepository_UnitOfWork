- Have to create a appplication through LinkedIn developer website.
- Got the client ID.
- Found this amazing link http://www.oauthforaspnet.com/providers/linkedin/
- Create the project again and set the Authentication to "Individual User Accounts".
- F12 to find out which URI is called.
- Problem.. call the logoff function to linked in... will fix later
- Created a faceboook app to make authentication.
- Problem.. facebook doesn't accept localhost domain... lets go to azure.
- It wasn't a problem I needed to add a Plataform
- The log off problem is because there is an authentication in another tab in the same browser. NOT A PROBLEM.
